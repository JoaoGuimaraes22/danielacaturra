          Breathing Shapes reflects on the synesthetic and emotional
          relationship we have with objects. As subjects immersed in a consumer
          society, we live surrounded by objects and are defined in terms of
          identity by and through them. Understanding how people interact with
          and attach meaning to objects can help us better understand their
          values, needs, and behaviors. (Object) Noun, anything that is visible
          or tangible and is relatively stable in form.
